+ Conductor is an orchestration engine that runs in the cloud
+ Motivation
 + We built Conductor to help us orchestrate microservices based process flows at Netflix with the following features:
    + Allow creating **complex process / business flows** in which individual task is implemented by a microservice.
    + A **JSON DSL** based blueprint defines the execution flow
    + User interface to visualize the process flows
    + Ability to scale **millions of concurrently running process flows**
+ Why not peer to peer choreography?
