Manifesto

+ graph storage
    + entities (kNodes)
        + knowledge nodes
            + songs
            + poems
            + facts
            + ...
            + people
            + groups
                + (initially, people, what/who were separately)
                + now they are also knowledge nodes
    + connections (kEdges)
+ human explorable knowledge
+ support knowledge fee
+ there are no higher level of knowledge initially, to make it isomorph processing, ...
    + user explores knowledge as plain knowledge
    + some semantic puzzles are extending knowledge and provides meaning
        + knowledge -> presentation
            + knowledge narration
        + IBIS
        + brainstorming
+ knowledge content one, knowledge visualisation other (multiple)
+ transclusion
+ multilingualism
+ cross-knowledge
    + users
    + individual
    + collective

# Analysis

## Privileges/Privacy

+ Multiple level of privacy for every entity
    + like rwx, and ugo(a) for Linux

## Maps

+ type: must be unique
    + there is no entity for registration
+ parentMapId:
    + wrong, hyerarh instead of graph
        + kEdge could be relationship between maps
+ revisions
+ versions
    + how to implement appropriatelly

## kNodes

+ mapId
    + big problem
+ visuals
    + isOpen
        + problem with other users
        + yes, it was idea that different users can have different view
        + unfortunatelly it is not implemented
    + x,y cooridnates
        + manual vs. automatic positioning and morphing
+ privacy
+ decorations
    + probably additional knodes that decorate the node
+ DataTalks
    + state-diagram
+ up
    + like OSI network layer
    + TCP is UP from IP, IP is UP from 
    + there is content and type of upper "protocol", "puzzle", "application" that knows how to deal with them
