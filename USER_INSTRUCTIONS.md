# Brainstorming

_**Nominal Group Technique**_

## About
+ The nominal group technique (NGT) is a group process involving problem identification, solution generation, and decision making.
+ First, every member of the group gives their view of the solution, with a short explanation. Then, duplicate solutions are eliminated from the list of all solutions, and the members proceed to rank the solutions, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on.
+ This diversity often allows the creation of a hybrid idea (combining parts of two or more ideas), often found to be even better than those ideas being initially considered.
+ In the basic method, the numbers each solution receives are totaled, and the solution with the highest (i.e. most favored) total ranking is selected as the final decision.

## Phases
1. `%IBIS% : Question` to be brainstormed about is created by moderator
1. **Silent generation of ideas**
  + Each participant creates as much as possible `%IBIS% : Idea`-s that come to his mind when considering the question.
  + All ideas are **private** at this phase.
  + This phase lasts approximately _10 minutes_.
1. **Sharing ideas**
  + Participants one by one present (make public) one by one of their ideas
  + There is **no debate about items** at this stage
  + Participants are encouraged to write down any **new ideas** that may arise from what others share.
  + This stage may take _15–30 minutes_
  + _**Notes. Open?**_
    + we can support round robin (token) guidance.
    + Will new ideas be public or private?
    + :warning: There may be hundred(s) of sibling ideas!! How to manage them? Visual map is going to be disturbed!?! Participants will be lost in finding their ideas to present
1. **Group discussion**
  + Participants are invited to seek verbal explanation or further details about any of the ideas that colleagues have produced that may not be clear to them.
  + The facilitator’s task is to ensure that each person is allowed to contribute and that discussion of all ideas is thorough without spending too long on a single idea.
  + It is important to ensure that the process is as **neutral** as possible, **avoiding judgment and criticism (no evaluative comments!)**.
  + The group may suggest **new items for discussion** and combine items into categories, but **no ideas should be eliminated**.
  + This stage lasts _30–45 minutes_
1. **Voting and ranking**
  + This involves prioritizing the recorded ideas in relation to the original question.
  + Following the voting and ranking process, immediate results in response to the question is available to participants so the meeting concludes having reached a specific outcome.
  + Voting is done by **secret ballot**
  + _**Notes. Open?**_
    + How to vote? Ranking or giving several thumbs up? How to know which votes are yours?
    + UNDO voting?
    + Knowing your votes?

## NGT in Details
+ As compared to interacting groups the NGT groups provide more unique ideas, more balanced participation between group members, increased feelings of accomplishment, and greater satisfaction with idea quality and group efficiency
+ some members are reluctant to create **conflict** in groups. (Many people want to maintain a pleasant climate.) NGT overcomes these problems
+ Some of the **issues with NGT** is: Opinions may not converge in the voting process, cross-fertilization of ideas may be constrained
+ **Adaptation for ill-structured problems**
Modification of NGT, undertaken by Bartunek and Murnighan[13] , helps to deal with ill-structured problems. Normal ideas are generated and listed, followed by the facilitator questioning if the ideas are relevant to the same problem. If not, the problem is said to be ill-structured, and the ideas generated are clustered into coherent groups. These clusters of ill-structured ideas are then treated as problems in their own right, and the NGT procedure is applied to them. Regular breaks are taken by the participants to ensure that the group feels they are still working on the original problem.
