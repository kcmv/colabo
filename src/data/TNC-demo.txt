		Interaction Types
			Quantum physics allows for interaction types that are beyond mechanistic causality (common knowledge).
		Macroscopic Quantum System

			- shown by Russian-Ukrainian school of microwave resonance therapy
		Quantum system can behave as a memory
		Mathematical isomorphism
		- Mathematical isomorphism between Feynman’s version of the Schrödinger equation and Hopfield’s neural network model indicates that a quantum system can behave as a memory (shown by M. Peruš).
