Thank you very much Garry for mentioning the conference! Indeed fusion of tecnhical and socio-humanities into Cognitive Intelligence topic is always exciting, so please keep us informed!

Regarding the NY event, we understand your unavailability. We still can do 2 beneficial things:

1) recognize your support of the initiative, putting your (supporting) logo as we did with the Serbian Ministry of Telecommunication and the biggest national mobile provider (plus other sponzors)
2) get few vignetes (pearles of wisdom) from the WAAS community that we will use and fertilize across various transdisciplinary events (more on that soon)



Dear Sasha

Thank you for the invitation and information about your very interesting event. Regrettably I will be in Seoul on those days. I might mention that next July the World Academy of Art & Science will be partnering with IEEE for a conference on Cognitive Intelligence in Milan. Most of the attendees with be technical people. WAAS is bringing representatives from the social science and humanities. It sounds like your work might be a good fit. If you are interested, we can keep you informed as the conference agenda develops.  

Best regards
Garry
