# INSTALL

If you are integrating with angular CLI you should add in `.angular-cli.json`
- JS files
- CSS files

both of them are specified in `config.js` file. With our Colabo builder that is colabo-puzzle-friendly we do not need to do that

You also need to install puzzle's interal dependencies. This is necessary only while package is local only (not published on npm services and not installed through npm services): `yarn install`
