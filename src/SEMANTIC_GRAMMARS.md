# Node-relationships

Relationships between nodes and possible children nodes are described with semantic grammars.

Elements of a grammar tell what a possible node is that can succeed the node, and what realationship (edge) types between nodes are possible.

For each node that is selected, a set of possible actions are decided based on the node type, state, and context.

Therefore, if we select a node, KnAllEdge should be capable of providing a set of possible actions based on supported grammars.
