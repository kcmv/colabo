# RIMA

Sasa Rudan: gledam malo za ono map->rima
Sasa Rudan: nije naivno (smiley)
Sasa Rudan: mislim nije problem da se izvede
Sasa Rudan: ali je problem kako pristupiti problemu (smiley)
Sasa Rudan: KO je tu GLAVNI koji odlucuje, itd
Sasa Rudan: po meni je najlogicnije da RIMA ne radi nista (to mozemo i konfigurisati kao ponasanje) dok KnAlledge Map servis ne ucita mapu, i tada samo proslijedi listu usera koji nas interesuju RIMA servisu i tada ih on povuce
Sasa Rudan: mada za sada mislim da nemamo RIMA poziv ka serveru koji prima listu usera, mada nam to naravno treba

The Russian event we mentioned you has officially finished and we had a very cool international poetic and drawing art reflection to journalist reportage, a kind of cross-discipline and society feedback loop. The event became viral in Russia and we want to extend it with few more invitation-only poets like you. We will also join it with 24h Literature Marathon in Belgrade, Serbia. Are you interested to take part in any of them?

Dear Saumya,

How are you doing? I just saw a poem about her Majesty Vagina! pretty cool :) In Serbian vagina is called "—Ä–∏–±–∏—Ü–∞" = 'little fish' :D

I am currently in Russia, Sinisha just came back and there in snowy Siberia we just finished a first round of an interesting trans-disciplinary and inter-national artistic experiment.

It was a CoLaboArthon between journalists and artists. We invited international artists to make their artistic reflections on instant/short-form of journalism. It was an event of few hundred journalists. We see it really important and interesting to engage poets and other artists with that flow of real and touching journalistic stories and a dialogue and exchange of emotions across nations.

We want to do a 2nd round tomorrow and introduce more artists. We sent a post on your FB group. Could you please approve the post?

We will soon do more exotic practices and keep you updated.

Best,
Siniha and Sasha

We will do it much

here is an official description:
in short, it's an interesting, but a time-limited (and now, invitation-only) offer for international poetic collaboration üôÇ
Our ChaOS organization is organizing an international CoLaboArthon event at a big journalist event.
Journalists were going around the Siberian, Russian city of Tyumen and collecting stories/photos.
Your task is to choose a story that inspires you and give your short poetic reflection.
So, if you want to make an interesting yet simple collaboration with journalists and other poets/artist; if you want some of your verses to be published in Russia;
and later read at the 24h Literature Marathon in Belgrade, Serbia, here is our event - just join it and all explanation is there:
https://www.facebook.com/events/169175616936761/
BUT you have some 48hrs, till Friday, 23:59 CET üòâ
what is more than enough, because we expect just few impressionistic verses as you will see in comments on photos, done by other poets already
I‚Äôm here for any question!
you can write in your own language üòâ

- interviewing them
- each group should have a concrete issue of conflict so
  - it can be input for us so our lab can work on real problems
  - participant will be more involved
- we need to identify what we are
- each event
- participants can split
- motivating other stakeholders
- big LARS game for practicing
- we have NGO
