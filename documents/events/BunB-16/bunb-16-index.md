This workshop is a real-time practice of collaboration between scientists and artists addressing the ecologycal problems of drilling oil in the [Yasuni National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuni_National_Park), Ecuador. It is supported by collaborative dialogue augmenting platform CollaboFramework.

An outmost goal was succeeding in development of the collaborative-system with unobtrusive and continuous **knowledge-dialogue-decision-action-learn** cycle:

The <span style='color: #550000'>Collabo</span><span style='color: #bb0000'>Framework</span> is an umbrella platform for [CollaboScience](www.CollaboScience.com) and [CollaboArte](www.CollaboArte.com) that are both in their own ways connecting worlds of Science, Art, Humanities and audience.

CollaboFramework aims to provide a ***Collective Mind*** (concepts pionireed with Douglas C. Engelbart and Warner Bush) of society and augments capabilities of solving ***Wicked Problems***.

CollaboFramework creates an active dialogue arena inside the ***Community of Practice*** - in this case dealing with the ecologycal problem in the Yasuni National Park.

You will have a chance to ***participate in the real-time collaboration*** and contribute creating scientific and artistic artefacts and be part of knowledge gardening process.

The outcome of the workshop will be used in the ***post-event period*** which will serve as an creative space for inspiration and motivation of artists for creating artistic pieces.

In order to fully participate the workshop, you need to ***register*** in the CollaboFramework and ***describe*** yourself through your interests in order to help the system to match your expertises and interests with other participants and integrate you with knowledge gardening process.

Some of the main motivations behind developing <span style='color: #550000'>Collabo</span><span style='color: #bb0000'>Framework</span> are the following:

* support of collective "knowledge-gardening" (thanks to Jack Park for the term)
* support for psycho-sociological and mediation patterns of knowledge gardening
* create a semantic-agnostic knowledge model
* create a universal knowledge layer with zero-friction between SoA system components
* create extendable knowledge semantics
* support dialogical process of knowledge creation
* support multi-truth knowledge
* support fuzzy-knowledge
* support personalized knowledge
