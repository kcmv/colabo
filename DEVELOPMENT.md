# Development

This page describes the process of developing extra component.

## Branching

If you want to develop additional feature, the safest procedure is to create a separate git branch. **NOTE**: This requires developer write access to the CF project.

### creating branch

After you have created the new branch, you should switch to that branch and start working in it.
